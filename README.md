# Using-R-Random-Forest-for-Website-traffic-analysis

This is one of the ML implementation using another powerful language other than pyhton.
This time we will be working with R language using IDE suitable for R language.
In this ML project, I have worked with a powerful algorithm that is "Random Forest". Random forest is the collection of 
many decision trees. It's one of the most prominent algorithm that workks to find the relationship between the data in the dataset.
Most often it's not used in the time series analysis, but here I have experimented it over this task. And the results were outstanding at the output end.
This repository shows the application of time series analysis. Time series analysis is one of the most prominent task performed in the world of ML.
