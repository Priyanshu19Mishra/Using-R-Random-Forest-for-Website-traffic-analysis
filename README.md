# Using-R-Random-Forest-for-Website-traffic-analysis

This is one of the ML implementation using another powerful language other than pyhton. This time we will be working with R language using IDE suitable for R language.In this ML project, I have worked with a powerful algorithm that is "Random Forest". 

Random Forest is a powerful machine learning algorithm often used in website traffic forecasting due to its ability to handle both regression and classification problems, its flexibility with high-dimensional data, and its robustness against overfitting.
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training and merges their outputs to make more accurate predictions. In the context of website traffic forecasting, it can help predict the number of visitors or sessions based on various time-based features.
Data Preprocessing: The data often includes features like time of the day, day of the week, month, or lag variables (e.g., previous traffic or session data). These features must be carefully prepared and cleaned for better accuracy.
Model Training: Random Forest trains multiple decision trees on different subsets of the data. Each tree makes a prediction, and the final forecast is derived by averaging the results of all trees.
Prediction: For website traffic, Random Forest can predict continuous values (e.g., number of visits) based on the learned patterns in past traffic data.

Random forest is the collection of many decision trees. It's one of the most prominent algorithm that workks to find the relationship between the data in the dataset.
Most often it's not used in the time series analysis, but here I have experimented it over this task. And the results were outstanding at the output end.

Advantages of Random Forest in Website Traffic Forecasting:
Handles Non-linear Relationships: Website traffic often follows complex patterns due to factors like seasonality, holidays, or events. Random Forest can capture non-linear dependencies between time-related features and traffic.
Robustness Against Overfitting: Since Random Forest averages the predictions from multiple trees, it prevents overfitting compared to a single decision tree model.
Feature Importance: Random Forest can provide insights into which features (e.g., time of day, lagged traffic data) are most important for accurate forecasting.

This repository shows the application of time series analysis. Time series analysis is one of the most prominent task performed in the world of ML.
Time series analysis is used in most of the time under the web-development. One such example is the website traffic forecasting. Using this application 
one can predict the load on a particular website as per the user request that one encounters.
A R file has been shared in the in repository that shows the implementation of the project. All the visual on the working of the model of the project has been
added and shown in the R file file which shows the implementation protion. The model is so much linear in nature. The outputs and performance has been shared 
through the visuals in the repository. 
The graphs and the images of the dataset has been shared in the repository. Its too highly scalable project. An attempt to use Random forest that uses decision 
trees is highly pasionate. 

To run the repo, use the R file in an R supporting IDE, and install the necessary header file. I have implemented this using Google Colab. Google Colab is one such prominent
platform that is very much used and appropriate for ML task.
All the other details has been  uploaded along with the plots and accuracy matrices. These matrices accurately analyses the model performance. All the images of the model 
performance has been uploaded in this particular repository.
These are the performance matrices that explains in detail the working and the training of the model in vast detail. This project holds a deep future scope in every way in respect 
to the architecture and the performance.
